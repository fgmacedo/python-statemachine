# StateMachine 2.3.2

*Not released yet*

## What's new in 2.3.2

Observers are now rebranded to {ref}`listeners`. With expanted support for adding listeners when
instantiating a state machine. This allows covering more use cases.

### Improved async support

Since version 2.3.0, we have added async support. However, we encountered use cases, such as the [async safety on Django ORM](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/async/#async-safety), which expects no running event loop and blocks if it detects one on the current thread.

To address this issue, we developed a solution that maintains a unified API for both synchronous and asynchronous operations while effectively handling these scenarios.

This is achieved through a new concept called "engine," an internal strategy pattern abstraction that manages transitions and callbacks.

There are two engines:

SyncEngine
: Activated if there are no async callbacks. All code runs exactly as it did before version 2.3.0.

AsyncEngine
: Activated if there is at least one async callback. The code runs asynchronously and requires a running event loop, which it will create if none exists.

These engines are internal and are activated automatically by inspecting the registered callbacks in the following scenarios:

See {ref}`async` for more details.
```


### Listeners at class initialization

Listeners are a way to generically add behavior to a state machine without changing its internal implementation.

Example:

```py
>>> from tests.examples.traffic_light_machine import TrafficLightMachine

>>> class LogListener(object):
...     def __init__(self, name):
...         self.name = name
...
...     def after_transition(self, event, source, target):
...         print(f"{self.name} after: {source.id}--({event})-->{target.id}")
...
...     def on_enter_state(self, target, event):
...         print(f"{self.name} enter: {target.id} from {event}")


>>> sm = TrafficLightMachine(listeners=[LogListener("Paulista Avenue")])
Paulista Avenue enter: green from __initial__

>>> sm.cycle()
Paulista Avenue enter: yellow from cycle
Paulista Avenue after: green--(cycle)-->yellow
'Running cycle from green to yellow'

```

```{seealso}
See {ref}`listeners` for more details.
```

### Binding event triggers to external objects

Now it's possible to bind events to external objets. One expected use case is in conjunction with the {ref}`Mixins` models,
that wrap state machines internally. This way you don't need to expose the state machine.


```{seealso}
See {ref}`sphx_glr_auto_examples_user_machine.py` for an example binding event triggers with a state machine.
```


## Bugfixes in 2.3.2

- Fixes [#446](https://github.com/fgmacedo/python-statemachine/issues/446): Regression that broke sync callbacks
  interacting with Django ORM due to the added async support and
  [Django's async safety guards](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/async/#async-safety).
- Fixes [#449](https://github.com/fgmacedo/python-statemachine/issues/449): Regression that did not trigger events
  in nested calls within an already running transition.


## Deprecation notes

### Statemachine class deprecations in 2.3.2

Deprecations that will be removed on the next major release:

- `StateMachine.add_observer` is deprecated in favor of `StateMachine.add_listener`.
- `StateMachine.rtc` option is deprecated. We'll keep only the **run-to-completion** (RTC) model.
