# StateMachine 2.3.0

*Not released yet*

## What's new in 2.3.0

In this release, we conducted a significant update focusing on adding asynchronous support, and enhancing overall functionality. In fact, the approach we took was to go all the way down changing the internals of the library to be fully async, keeping only the current external API as a thin sync wrapper.

Here are the major changes and new features:

### Asynchronous Support in 2.3.0

This release introduces native coroutine support using asyncio, enabling seamless integration with asynchronous code.

Now you can send and await for events, and also write async {ref}`Actions`, {ref}`Conditions` and {ref}`Validators`.


```{seealso}
See {ref}`sphx_glr_auto_examples_air_conditioner_machine.py` for an example of
async code with a state machine.
```


```py
>>> class AsyncStateMachine(StateMachine):
...     initial = State('Initial', initial=True)
...     final = State('Final', final=True)
...
...     advance = initial.to(final)

>>> async def run_sm():
...     sm = AsyncStateMachine()
...     await sm.advance()
...     print(sm.current_state)

>>> asyncio.run(run_sm())
Final

```


### Manual Initial State Activation for Async Code

When working with asynchronous state machines from async code, users must manually activate
the initial state . This change ensures proper state initialization and execution flow given that
Python don't allow awaiting at class initalization time and the initial state activation may contain
async callbacks that must be awaited.

```py
>>> async def initialize_sm():
...     sm = AsyncStateMachine()
...     await sm.activate_initial_state()
...     return sm

>>> sm = asyncio.run(initialize_sm())
>>> print(sm.current_state)
Initial

```
