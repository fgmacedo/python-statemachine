# StateMachine 2.0.0

*Not released yet*

Welcome to StateMachine 2.0.0!

This version is the first to take advantage of the Python3 improvements. We're on our way to implementing features following the SCXML specs. We hope that you enjoy it.

These release notes cover the [](#whats-new-in-20), as well as
some [backwards incompatible changes](#backwards-incompatible-changes-in-20) you'll
want to be aware of when upgrading from StateMachine 1.*. We've
[begun the deprecation process for some features](#deprecated-features-in-20).


## Python compatibility in 2.0

StateMachine 2.0 supports Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11.


## What's new in 2.0


### Added support for internal transitions

An internal transition is like a {ref}`self transition`, but in contrast, no entry or exit actions
are ever executed as a result of an internal transition.

```py
>>> from statemachine import StateMachine, State

>>> class TestStateMachine(StateMachine):
...     initial = State("initial", initial=True)
...
...     loop = initial.to.itself(internal=True)

```

```{seealso}
See {ref}`internal transition` for more details.
```


## Minor features in 2.0

- Modernization of the development stack to use linters.
- [#342](https://github.com/fgmacedo/python-statemachine/pull/342): Guards now supports the
  evaluation of **truthy**** and **falsy** values.
- [#342](https://github.com/fgmacedo/python-statemachine/pull/342): Assignment of `Transition`
  guards using decorators is now possible.
