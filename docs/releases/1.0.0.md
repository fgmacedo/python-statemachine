# StateMachine 1.0.0

*January 6, 2022*

Welcome to StateMachine 1.0!

These release notes cover the [](#whats-new-in-10), as well as
some [backwards incompatible changes](#backwards-incompatible-changes-in-10) you'll
want to be aware of when upgrading from StateMachine 0.9.0 or earlier. We've
[begun the deprecation process for some features](#deprecated-features-in-10).


## Python compatibility

StateMachine 1.0 supports Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11.

This is the last release to support Python 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6.

## What's new in 1.0


### Validators and Guards

Transitions now support `conditions` and `unless` parameters, to restrict
the execution.

```python
    class ApprovalMachine(StateMachine):
        "A workflow machine"
        requested = State("Requested", initial=True)
        accepted = State("Accepted")
        rejected = State("Rejected")
        completed = State("Completed")

        validate = requested.to(accepted, conditions="is_ok") | requested.to(rejected)
```

```{seealso}
See {ref}`validators-and-guards` for more details.
```

### Support for diagrams

You can generate diagrams from your statemachine.

Example:

![OrderControl](../images/order_control_machine_initial.png)


```{seealso}
See {ref}`diagrams` for more details.
```

### Unified dispatch mecanism for callbacks (actions and guards)

Every single callback, being {ref}`actions` or {ref}`guards`, is now handled equally by the library.

Also, we've improved the internals in a way that you can implement your callbacks with any
number of arbritrary positional or keyword arguments (`*args, **kwargs`), and the dispatch will
match the available arguments with your method signature.

This means that if on your `on_enter_<state>()` or `on_execute_<event>()` method, you also
need to know the `source` ({ref}`state`), or the `event` ({ref}`event`), or access a keyword
argument passed with the trigger, you're covered. Just add this parameter to the method and It
 will be passed by the dispatch mechanics.

Example of what's available:

```py
def action_or_guard_method_name(self, *args, event_data, event, source, state, model, **kwargs):
    pass
```

```{seealso}
See {ref}`dynamic-dispatch` for more details.
```

## Minor features

- Fixed mypy complaining about incorrect type for ``StateMachine`` class.
- The initial {ref}`state` is now entered when the machine starts. The {ref}`actions`, if defined,
  `on_enter_state` and `on_enter_<state>` are now called.



## Backwards incompatible changes in 1.0

- Drop support for monkey-patching add callbacks at machine runtime.
- statemachine integrity checks are performed at import time instead of when
  instance creation. This allows early feedback on invalid definitions.
- Drop support for adding `validators` as assigment to a `Transition`.
- `TransitionNotAllowed` changed internal attr from `transition` to `event`.


## Deprecated features in 1.0

### Statemachine class

- `StateMachine.run` is deprecated in favor of `StateMachine.send`.
- `StateMachine.allowed_transitions` is deprecated in favor of `StateMachine.allowed_events`.

### State class

- `State.identification` is deprecated in favor of `State.id`.
