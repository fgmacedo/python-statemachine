# StateMachine 1.0.0

*January 2, 2022*

Welcome to StateMachine 1.0!

These release notes cover the [](#whats-new-in-10), as well as
some [backwards incompatible changes](#backwards-incompatible-changes-in-10) you'll
want to be aware of when upgrading from StateMachine 0.9.0 or earlier. We've
[begun the deprecation process for some features](#deprecated-features-in-10).


## Python compatibility

StateMachine 1.0 supports Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11.


## What's new in 1.0


### Validators and Guards

Transitions now support `conditions` and `unless` parameters, to restrict
the execution.

```python
    class ApprovalMachine(StateMachine):
        "A workflow machine"
        requested = State("Requested", initial=True)
        accepted = State("Accepted")
        rejected = State("Rejected")
        completed = State("Completed")

        validate = requested.to(accepted, conditions="is_ok") | requested.to(rejected)
```

See {ref}`validators-and-guards` for more details.

### Support for diagrams

You can generate diagrams from your statemachine.

Example:

![OrderControl](../images/order_control_machine_initial.png)


See {ref}`diagrams` for more details.


## Minor features

- Fixed mypy complaining about incorrect type for ``StateMachine`` class.


## Backwards incompatible changes in 1.0

- Drop support for monkey-patching add callbacks at machine runtime.
* statemachine integrity checks are performed at import time instead of when
  instance creation. This allows early feedback on invalid definitions.
* Drop support for adding `validators` as assigment to `Event`.
* `TransitionNotAllowed` changed internal attr from `transition` to `event`.


## Deprecated features in 1.0

- `StateMachine.run` is deprecated in favor of `StateMachine.send`.
- `StateMachine.allowed_transitions` is deprecated in favor of `allowed_events`.
