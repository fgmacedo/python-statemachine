# StateMachine 0.8.0

*2020-01-23*

## Python compatibility on 0.8.0

- Add support for Python 3.7 and 3.8 (adding to test matrix).
- Drop official support for Python 3.4 (removing from test matrix, code may still work).

## What's new in 0.8

- Update development requirements.
- State machine names should now be fully qualified for mixins, simple names are deprecated and
  will no longer be supported on a future version.
- Development: Adding mypy linter.
- Add support for State machine inheritance. Thanks @rschrader.
- Add support for reverse transitions: ``transition = state_a.from_(state_b)``.
  Thanks @romulorosa.
- Fix current state equal to destination on enter events. Thanks @robnils and @joshuacc1.
- Check: StateMachine now validates if it's states/transitions graph has only one component.
  Thanks @rafaelrds.
