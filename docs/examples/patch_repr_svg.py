    You're running this example directly from your browser! By using the amazing
    https://pyodide.org/.

    Since we're in a browser, the default dependency of GraphViz installed locally don't work. So
    as an option to see our examples and try the library on the fly without the need to
    install anything we'll patch `StateMachine._repr_html_` to retrieve the svg diagram online as
    the graphviz is not available.

    This method will serialize and request the graph to an external service: https://quickchart.io.
    By using de diagrams support you trust quickchart.io. Please read
    https://quickchart.io/documentation/faq/.
