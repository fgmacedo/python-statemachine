"""
Async guess the number machine
==============================

An async example of StateMachine for the well know game.

In order to pay the game, run this script and type a number between 1 and 5.
The command line should include an extra param to run the script in interactive mode:

On the root folder of the project, run:

    ``python tests/examples/async_guess_the_number_machine.py -i``

It's worth to mention that the same state machine can be used in syncronous code, as shown in the
docstring of the class. You can play on sync contextif you also pass the `-s` flag:

    ``python tests/examples/async_guess_the_number_machine.py -i -s``
